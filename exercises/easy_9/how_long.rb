# Write a method that takes a string as an argument,
# and returns an Array that contains every word from the string,
# to which you have appended a space and the word length.

# You may assume that words in the string are separated by exactly
# one space, and that any substring of non-space characters is a word.

def word_lengths(string)
  string.split.map { |word| "#{word} #{word.size}" }
end

# Examples:
puts word_lengths("cow sheep chicken") == ["cow 3", "sheep 5", "chicken 7"]

puts word_lengths("baseball hot dogs and apple pie") == [
  "baseball 8", "hot 3", "dogs 4", "and 3", "apple 5", "pie 3"
]

puts word_lengths("It ain't easy, is it?") == [
  "It 2", "ain't 5", "easy, 5", "is 2", "it? 3"
]

puts word_lengths("Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious") == [
  "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious 34"
]

puts word_lengths("") == []
