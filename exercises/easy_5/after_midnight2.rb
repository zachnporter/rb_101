# As seen in the previous exercise, the time of day can be represented
# as the number of minutes before or after midnight.
# If the number of minutes is positive, the time is after midnight.
# If the number of minutes is negative, the time is before midnight.

# Write two methods that each take a time of day in 24 hour format,
# and return the number of minutes before and after midnight, respectively.
# Both methods should return a value in the range 0..1439.

# You may not use ruby's Date and Time methods.

MINUTES_PER_HOUR = 60
HOURS_PER_DAY = 24
MINUTES_PER_DAY = MINUTES_PER_HOUR * HOURS_PER_DAY

def before_midnight(time)
  hours, minutes = time.split(':').map(&:to_i)
  (MINUTES_PER_DAY - (hours * MINUTES_PER_HOUR + minutes)) % MINUTES_PER_DAY
end

def after_midnight(time)
  hours, minutes = time.split(':').map(&:to_i)
  (hours * MINUTES_PER_HOUR + minutes) % MINUTES_PER_DAY
end

# Examples:
p after_midnight('00:00') == 0
p before_midnight('00:00') == 0
p after_midnight('12:34') == 754
p before_midnight('12:34') == 686
p after_midnight('24:00') == 0
p before_midnight('24:00') == 0
p after_midnight('00:35') == 35
p before_midnight('00:35') == 1405

# Yes, we know that 24:00 isn't a valid time in 24-hour format.
# Humor us, though; it makes the problem more interesting.

# Disregard Daylight Savings and Standard Time and other irregularities.
