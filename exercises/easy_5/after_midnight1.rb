# The time of day can be represented as the number of minutes
# before or after midnight. If the number of minutes is positive,
# the time is after midnight. If the number of minutes is negative,
# the time is before midnight.

# Write a method that takes a time using this minute-based format
# and returns the time of day in 24 hour format (hh:mm).
# Your method should work with any integer input.

# You may not use ruby's Date and Time classes.
