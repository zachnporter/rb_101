# Write a method that takes two arguments: the first is the starting number,
# and the second is the ending number. Print out all numbers between the two
# numbers, except if a number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz", if a number is
# divisible by 5, print "Buzz", and finally if a number is divisible by 3 and 5,
# print "FizzBuzz".

  if num % 3 == 0 && num % 5 == 0
    "FizzBuzz"
  elsif num % 3 == 0

  elsif num % 5 == 0
    "Buzz"
  else

  start_num.upto(end_num) do |num|

# Example:
fizzbuzz(1, 15)
# 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz
