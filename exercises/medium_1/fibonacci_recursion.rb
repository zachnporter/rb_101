# The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers starting with 1 and 1 where each
# number is the sum of the two previous numbers: the 3rd Fibonacci number
# is 1 + 1 = 2, the 4th is 1 + 2 = 3, the 5th is 2 + 3 = 5, and so on.

# In mathematical terms:
# F(1) = 1
# F(2) = 1
# F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2) where n > 2

# Sequences like this translate naturally as "recursive" methods.
# A recursive method is one in which the method calls itself.
# For example:

# def sum(n)
#   return 1 if n == 1
#   n + sum(n - 1)
# end

# sum is a recursive method that computes the sum of all integers between 1 & n.

# Recursive methods have three primary qualities:

# 1) They call themselves at least once.
# 1) They have a condition that stops the recursion (n == 1 above).
# 3) They use the result returned by themselves.
# In the code above, sum calls itself once;
# it uses a condition of n == 1 to stop recursing;
# and, n + sum(n - 1) uses the return value of the
# recursive call to compute a new return value.

# Write a recursive method that computes the nth Fibonacci number,
# where nth is an argument to the method.

def fibonacci(n)
  return 1 if n == 1 || n == 2
  fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
end

# Examples:
p fibonacci(1) == 1
p fibonacci(2) == 1
p fibonacci(3) == 2
p fibonacci(4) == 3
p fibonacci(5) == 5
p fibonacci(12) == 144
p fibonacci(20) == 6765
